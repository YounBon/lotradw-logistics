# Images for Assistant

Paste images here in one of two ways:

1) Markdown image link (preferred when using hosted images):

![description](https://example.com/image.png)

2) Base64 data URI (if you paste raw image data):

![screenshot](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...)

Notes:
- After you paste images, reply `done` in chat and I'll open and analyze them.
- Don't paste secrets (private keys, passwords) in images unless you're comfortable sharing.
- Each image should include a one-line caption above it describing what it is and why you pasted it.
